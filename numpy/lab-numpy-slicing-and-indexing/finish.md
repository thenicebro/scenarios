# Summary

Congratulations! You have completed the NumPy Slicing and Indexing Lab.

In this lab, you covered the basics of slicing and indexing NumPy arrays:

- Slicing allows you to extract a subset of an array by specifying a range of indices.
- Boolean indexing allows you to filter an array based on a condition.
- Fancy indexing allows you to extract specific elements or subsets of an array by using an array of indices.
