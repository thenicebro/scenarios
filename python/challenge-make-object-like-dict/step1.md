# Basic Functionality

## Introduction

Your first task is to create a class that can be used like a dictionary with basic functionality. The class should store key-value pairs and allow them to be accessed, added, and removed using square bracket notation.

## Target

Using the file we created called `basic_functionality.py`, use the object `DictLikeObject` to implement the following:

- Has an internal dictionary to store key-value pairs.
- Implements the `__getitem__` method to retrieve values using square bracket notation. If the key does not exist, raise a KeyError.
- Implements the `__setitem__` method to set values using square bracket notation.
- Implements the `__delitem__` method to remove key-value pairs using square bracket notation. If the key does not exist, raise a KeyError.
- Implements the `__len__` method to return the number of key-value pairs in the dictionary.

## Requirements

- The path of `basic_functionality.py` is `/home/labex/project`.
