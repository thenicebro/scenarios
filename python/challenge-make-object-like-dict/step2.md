# Advanced Functionality

## Introduction

Your next task is to implement additional magic methods to make your `DictLikeObject` even more powerful. You will implement the `__contains__`, `__iter__`, and `keys` methods to allow for membership testing, iteration, and getting a list of keys.

## Target

Using the file we created called `advanced_functionality.py`, use the object `DictLikeObject` to implement the following:

> Tips: You can copy the methods implemented in the `advanced_functionality.py` file here.

- Implement the `__contains__` method to allow for membership testing using the in keyword.
- Implement the `__iter__` method to allow for iteration over keys using a for loop.
- Implement a method called `keys` that returns a list of keys in the dictionary.

## Requirements

- The path of `advanced_functionality.py` is `/home/labex/project`.
