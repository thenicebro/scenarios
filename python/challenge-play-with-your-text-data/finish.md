# Summary

In this Python challenge, we learned how to use Python to analyze text data. We counted the total number of words in multiple files, identified the top three high-frequency words, extracted specific words from each file and wrote them to a separate output file. By completing this challenge, we have gained valuable skills that will help us work more effectively with text data in Python.
