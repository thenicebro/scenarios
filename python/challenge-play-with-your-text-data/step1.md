# Word Total Count

There are some text files in the `home/labex/files` folder.

Try to read them all in Python and count how many words total in the Python script `word_count.py`.

Punctuations are not words, for example, there are 111 words in the "java" file.

## Requirements

- The count result should be `print` in the console when executing the Python script.
