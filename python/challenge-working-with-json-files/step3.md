# Search What I Want

In this challenge, you should create a Python script `json_search.py`, this script accepts the file and key name argument and then print the result.

Meantime, the result should be formatted as **'The value for the key `key` in `file` is `value`.'**.

For example:

```bash
python json_search.py 1.json 1
# output in console:
# The value for the key 1 in 1.json is 3.
```

## Requirements

- The path of `json_search.py` is `/home/labex/project`.
- Do nothing if the file or key is not in the JSON file.
