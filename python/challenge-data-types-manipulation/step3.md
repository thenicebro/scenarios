# Dictionary Operations

Given a dictionary `input_dict`, write a function `dictionary_operations(input_dict)` that performs the following operations on the dictionary:

1. Add a key-value pair `{"new_key": "new_value"}` to the dictionary.
2. Remove the key "remove_key" and its corresponding value from the dictionary.
3. Return the final dictionary.
