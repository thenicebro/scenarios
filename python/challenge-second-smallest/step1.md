# Second Smallest

## Problem Statement

Given a list of integers, find the second smallest integer in the list. If the list contains less than two elements, return `None`.

## Input

A list of integers, numbers (1 <= len(numbers) <= 10^5)

## Output

The second smallest integer in the list, or None if the list contains less than two elements.

## Example

```bash
>>> second_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
2

>>> second_smallest([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
2

>>> second_smallest([1])
None
```

## Requirements

- Write a function second_smallest(numbers) that implements the solution in Python.
- Use the Walrus Operator in your solution.
- Your solution should be efficient in terms of time and space complexity.
- Your solution should be clear, readable, and well-documented.
