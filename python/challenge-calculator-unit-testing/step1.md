# Python Unit Testing

Your task is to write unit tests for each method of the `Calculator` class using the built-in `unittest` module in Python.

## TODO

Complete `calculator_unittest.py`

## Requirements

Your tests should ensure that each method behaves as expected under different input scenarios, including edge cases such as:

- Adding or subtracting zero.
- Multiplying by zero.
- Dividing by zero.
- Adding or subtracting positive and negative numbers.

Your tests should also verify that the methods raise the appropriate exceptions when passed invalid input.
