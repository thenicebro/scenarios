# Basic Assignment Expression

In this step, let's start with a simple example of using the walrus operator.

## Syntax format

Assignment expressions differ from normal assignment expressions in that they require parentheses next to the assignment statement when assigning a value to a variable.

Example:

```python
# General Style
variable_name = value

# Assignment Expression Style
(variable_name := value)
```

## Requirements

- Completing `/home/labex/project/basic_syntax.py`.
- Implements the `basic_syntax` function, use the walrus expression to define a variable named `answers` with a value of `42`, and return the `answers` variable.
