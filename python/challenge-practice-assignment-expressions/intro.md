# Practice Assignment Expressions

Welcome to the Python Assignment Expressions Challenge! In this challenge, you will practice using Python assignment expressions, also known as the `walrus operator` (`:=`). This operator allows you to assign values to variables as part of an expression, making your code more concise and efficient.

We will start with simple examples and gradually increase the complexity as you progress. This challenge is designed to help you understand and apply Python assignment expressions in a variety of scenarios.
