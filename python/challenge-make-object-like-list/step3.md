# Implementing List Concatenation

In this sub-challenge, you will implement list concatenation in the MagicList class.

## Requirements

- The class should have an `__add__` method that concatenates two lists.
- The class should have an `__iadd__` method that concatenates the list with another list in-place.

### Add Method

The `__add__` method uses the `+` operator to concatenate two lists.
The syntax of the `+` operator is:

```python
list1 + list2
```

### Iadd Method

The `__iadd__` method uses the `+=` operator to concatenate the list with another list in-place.
The syntax of the `+=` operator is:

```python
list1 += list2
```

## TODO

- Continue to complete `magic_list.py`.
- Add the necessary magic methods to support list concatenation in the `MagicList` class.
