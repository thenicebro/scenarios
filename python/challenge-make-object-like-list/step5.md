# Implementing List Sorting

In this sub-challenge, you will implement sorting operations in the MagicList class.

## Requirements

- The class should have a `__lt__` method that compares the items in the list for sorting.
- The class should have a `sort` method that sorts the list.

### It Method

The `__lt__` method uses the `<` operator to compare the items in the list for sorting.

### Sort Method

The `sort` method uses `sort()` function to sort the list.

## TODO

- Continue to complete `magic_list.py`.
- Add the necessary magic methods to support sorting operations in the `MagicList` class.
