# Implementing Basic List Operations

In this sub-challenge, you will implement basic list operations in the `MagicList` class.

## Requirements

- The class should have an `__init__` method that initializes the list with the given values.
- The class should have a `__len__` method that returns the length of the list.
- The class should have a `__str__` method that returns a string representation of the list.
- The class should support the `in` operator to check if an item is in the list.

### Init Method

The `__init__` method uses the `list()` function to initialize the list with the given values.

### Len Method

The `__len__` method uses the `len()` function to calculate the length of the list.

### Str Method

The `__str__` method uses the `str()` function to get a string representation of the list.

### In Operator

The `__contains__` method uses the `in` operator to check if an item is in the list.

## TODO

- Completing `magic_list.py`
- Create a class named `MagicList` that satisfies the requirements above.
