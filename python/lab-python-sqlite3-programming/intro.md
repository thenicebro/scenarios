# Python Sqlite3 Programming

In this lab, we will be working with the sqlite3 module in Python. SQLite is a popular lightweight relational database management system that is often used for embedded systems and mobile applications. It is also commonly used for small web applications or other projects that require a small database.

In this lab, we will cover the basics of SQLite and how to work with it in Python. We will start with a brief overview of SQLite and then move on to creating a database, inserting data, querying data, and finally updating and deleting data.
