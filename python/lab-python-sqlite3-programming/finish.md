# Summary

In this lab, we covered the basics of working with SQLite in Python. We started with creating a database, creating a table, inserting data, querying data, and finally updating and deleting data. The code examples went from simple to more complex operations.

We hope that this lab has helped you understand how to use SQLite in your Python projects. Remember, this is just the beginning and there are many more advanced features that you can explore with SQLite. Happy coding!
