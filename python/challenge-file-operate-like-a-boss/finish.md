# Summary

In this Python challenge, we learned about several common file operations, such as creating a folder, moving a file to a folder, and deleting a folder. We also implemented functions that perform these operations using Python code. By completing this challenge, we have gained valuable skills that will help us work more effectively with files in Python.
