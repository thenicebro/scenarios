# Count and Clean All

If you want to delete a folder, just right-click the folder and chose the delete button.

Now you should implement the `folder_delete` in `folder_delete.py`. It first counts how many files are in the folder and then deletes the folder.

for example:

```python
file_len = folder_delete('/home/labex/project/your_folder')
# your_folder should be deleted, and if there are 3 files in the folder,
# 3 will return.
print(file_len)
# 3
```

## Requirements

- The path of `folder_delete.py` is `/home/labex/project`, don't move it, and don't change the filename or function name.
- If folder not exists, return 0.
