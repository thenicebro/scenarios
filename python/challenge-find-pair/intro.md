# Find Pair

You are given a list of integers and a target value. Your task is to implement a function `find_pair()` that takes in the list of integers and the target value as parameters, and returns a tuple containing the indices of two elements in the list that add up to the target value. If there are multiple valid pairs, the function should return the indices of the first valid pair encountered.
