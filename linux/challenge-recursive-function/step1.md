# Recursive Function

Use a recursive function to print each argument passed to the function.

## Prerequisites:

- Working of functions in script.
- Argument passing to functions.
- Recursive functions.
- Script name: `recFunction.sh`.
- Work directory: `~/project`.

## Objective:

- Learn more about functions

## Requirements:

- We pass command-line arguments to script.
- Script call function with same arguments.
- Regardless of how many arguments are passed. You are allowed to echo only the first positional argument (`echo $1`).

## Sample Execution / Output:

```bash
labex:project/ $ bash recFunction.sh 12 a bc 3
[OUTPUT] Arguments passed are [OUTPUT]
