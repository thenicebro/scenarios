# Fibonacci

Read `n` and generate Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to n.

## Prerequisites:

- Knowledge about Fibonacci series.
- Script name: `fibonacci.sh`.
- Work directory: `~/project`.

## Objective:

- Learn to implement existing algorithms using loops.

## Requirements:

- Remember `n` is not the number of elements to print.
- It's the boundary of elements to print.

## Sample Execution / Output:

```bash
labex:project/ $ bash fibonacci.sh
[INPUT]Enter the value of N[INPUT]
15
[OUTPUT]Fibonacci Series of Given Number 15 is [OUTPUT]
0       1       1       2       3       5       8       13


largest of given fibonacci series is:13
```
