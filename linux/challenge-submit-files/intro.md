This challenge will test your knowledge of basic Git commands, specifically `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, and `git diff`. These commands are essential for version control and managing changes to your Git repository.

## Skills

- `git add`: This command adds changes to the staging area, preparing them to be committed.
- `git commit`: This command saves changes to the repository, creating a new commit with a unique ID.
- `git status`: This command shows the current status of the repository, including which changes are staged and which are not.
- `git diff`: This command shows the differences between two states of a file or between two different files.
