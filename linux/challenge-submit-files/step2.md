# Committing Changes to the Repository

## Introduction

In this step, you will learn how to use the `git commit` command to save changes to your repository. The `-m` option allows you to add a commit message that describes the changes you have made. After running this command, you can use the `git status` command to verify that the changes have been committed:

## Target

- Commit the changes that you staged in the previous step.
- View the status of the repository to verify that the changes have been committed.

## Result Example

The output of the `git status` command will show that your repository is up to date:

```bash
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

## Requirements

- A Git repository with at least one file.
- Make changes to the file.
- Stage the changes.
- Commit the changes.
- Verify that the repository is up to date.
