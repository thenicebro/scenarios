# Summary

In this lab, we learned about three important Git commands: `git restore`, `git rm`, and `git reset`. We learned how to use these commands to discard changes in the working directory, remove files from the Git repository, and unstage changes that have been added to the staging area. By mastering these commands, we can better manage our Git repositories and work more efficiently as developers.
