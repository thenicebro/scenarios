# Initialize Git Project

This lab provides a step-by-step guide on how to create a new Git repository using the `git init` command, and how to clone an existing Git repository using the `git clone` command.

The `git init` command is used to create a new repository from scratch, and is typically used when you are starting a new project or when you want to version control an existing project that was not previously under version control.

The `git clone` command, on the other hand, is used to create a copy of an existing repository, including all the version history and files, on your local machine. This is useful when you want to contribute to an existing project, or when you want to start working on a project that was already created and shared by someone else.
