# Git Necessary Files Directory

The `.git` directory is a special directory that is created when you initialize a new git repository using the `git init` command. It contains all the necessary files and directories for tracking changes to your code.

Here are some of the important files and directories that are typically found in the `.git` directory:

- `HEAD`: This file contains a pointer to the current branch of the repository.
- `config`: This file contains various configuration settings for the repository, such as the remote repository URL, user name, and email.
- `objects`: This directory contains all the objects that make up the git repository, such as commits, trees, and blobs.
- `refs`: This directory contains pointers to different branches and tags in the repository.
- `index`: This file is used as a staging area for changes that will be committed to the repository.
- `hooks`: This directory contains scripts that are run at various points in the git work-flow, such as when a commit is made or when changes are pushed to a remote repository.

The `.git` directory is hidden by default in most operating systems, but you can navigate to it by running `cd .git` command from the root of your local repository.

It's essential to understand that it's the heart of git repository and it's not recommended to modify any files or directories in this directory unless you know exactly what you are doing!

> Tips: now you can use `ls` command to view these files.
