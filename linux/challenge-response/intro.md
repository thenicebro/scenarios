# Response

In this challenge, you need to write a script that will respond differently based on the input provided by the user. The script should respond with 'Sure.' if the input is a question, 'Whoa, chill out!' if the input is all capital letters, 'Fine. Be that way!' if the user doesn't say anything, and 'Whatever.' for anything else.
