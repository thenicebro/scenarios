### Remove a File From the Repository

1. Use the git status command again to confirm that the changes have been undone.

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

2. Add a new file to the repository using the following commands:

   ```bash
   echo "This is a new file." > newfile.txt
   git add newfile.txt
   git commit -m "Add new file"
   ```

3. Remove the newfile.txt file from the repository using the rm command:

   ```bash
   git rm newfile.txt
   git commit -m "Remove new file"
   ```
