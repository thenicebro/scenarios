# Find File Location

In this challenge, you will learn how to find files on a Linux system using four different commands: `find`, `locate`, `which`, and `whereis`. Each command has its own set of strengths and weaknesses, and it's important to know which one to use in different situations.

## Skills

- `find`: A command-line utility that searches through one or more directory trees of a file system, locating files that match certain criteria.
- `locate`: A command that finds files by name quickly, using a pre-built index.
- `which`: A command that locates a command in your shell's search path.
- `whereis`: A command that locates the binary, source, and manual-page files for a command.
